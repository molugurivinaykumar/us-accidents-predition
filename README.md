# US Accidents Prediction Project Document
Please go through the report above for a brief understanding and model results

## Project Overview
The US Accidents Prediction project aims to create a machine learning model that predicts the severity of road accidents in the United States. The project utilizes data on traffic accidents collected from various sources to build a model that can predict the probability of an accident being fatal or resulting in injuries.

## Objective & Business Scope
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the severity of traffic accidents in the United States. The model will be beneficial for government agencies, law enforcement, and emergency services to allocate their resources effectively and improve road safety.

## Benefits for Users
- Provides accurate predictions of accident severity.
- Enables better allocation of resources for emergency services and law enforcement.
- Improves road safety and reduces the number of fatalities and injuries resulting from accidents.

## Narrative of Key Steps
1. Data collection and preprocessing
2. Exploratory data analysis
3. Feature engineering
4. Model selection and evaluation
5. Model deployment

The project started with data collection and preprocessing, where data on traffic accidents from various sources was collected and cleaned to remove inconsistencies and errors. Exploratory data analysis was performed to gain insights into the data and identify patterns and trends.

Feature engineering was performed to create new features that could improve the model's accuracy. Machine learning models, including decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting, were trained and evaluated using the data. Hyperparameter tuning was performed to optimize the models' performance.

The model's performance was evaluated using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Finally, the best-performing model was selected and deployed to a web application to enable users to input accident details and receive predictions on the accident's severity.

The web application was built using Flask, a Python web framework, and deployed on Heroku, making it accessible to the public. The project documentation includes a detailed description of the data sources, data preprocessing steps, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation metrics.
